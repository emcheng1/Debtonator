# Debtonator
This is a personal project in MATLAB that takes a matrix of debts owed among three people, creates a digraph, and then transforms the digraph into a minimal spanning tree such that the node strengths are preserved. This is meant to eliminate unnecessary transactions by simplifying monies owed.
